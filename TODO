* Continue refactoring and make this truly recursive.  The test for Hash vs OpenStruct-style lives in 3 places.  This is proof that the whole generation algorithm needs to be rethought 
* Add :limit option on sections
* Add :validation option for columns
* Add a validate_file() method to parse a file and run all validation tests (implies validation implemented)
* Better Documentation
* Alternate Section Flow (other than linear), i.e. repeatable sections (think batch)
* Add batched generation, so we don't turn into memory hogs
* Add batched parsing, so we don't turn into memory hogs
